        <hr width=100%>
        <p>The grizzly bear (Ursus arctos horribilis), also known as the North American brown bear or simply grizzly, is a large population or subspecies[1] of the brown bear inhabiting North America.

            Multiple morphological forms sometimes recognized as subspecies exist, including the mainland grizzly (Ursus arctos horribilis), Kodiak bear (U. a. middendorffi), peninsular grizzly (U. a. gyas), and the recently extinct Californian (U. a. californicus†)[2][3] Mexican (U. a. nelsoni†) and Ungava-Labrador grizzlies (U. a. ungavaesis†). On average bears near the coast tend to be larger while inland grizzlies tend to be smaller.
            
            The Ussuri brown bear (U. a. lasiotus) inhabiting Russia, Northern China, Japan and Korea is sometimes referred to as the black grizzly, although it is a different subspecies from the bears in America.

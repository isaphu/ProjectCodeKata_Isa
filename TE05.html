        <p><u>Weapons of Math Destruction: How Big Data Increases Inequality and Threatens Democracy</u>
        The book is written by <u>Cathy O'Neil</u> and this is the description of the book We live in the age of the algorithm. Increasingly, the decisions that affect our lives—where we go to school, 
        whether we get a car loan, how much we pay for health insurance—are being made not by humans, but by mathematical models. 
        In theory, this should lead to <b><i>greater</i></b> fairness: Everyone is judged according to the same rules, and bias is eliminated.
        But as Cathy O’Neil reveals in this <b><i>urgent</i></b> and necessary book, the <b><i>opposite</i></b> is <b><i>true</i></b>. The models being used today are <b><i>opaque</i></b>, <b><i>nregulated</i></b>, and <b><i></i>uncontestable</i></b>, even when they’re wrong.
